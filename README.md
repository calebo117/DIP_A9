# DIP_A9
Digital Image Processing Project - Team A9 - Morphological Operations

Presentation Link: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1F_Ba2MjPBj93EiILTtxTlsrjyk7vGnHcf4_S4pWLHWc/edit?usp=sharing

## How to Run
in a python configured terminal with cv2, numpy, and tkinter libraries type:
"python gui.py"

## Objectives

#### Identify the effects of morphological operations on an image
  Provide visual reference of the changes (logical operators)
  Single & compound operations
  Blob counting on output image to show changes numerically
  Compare how the window shape/size affects the outcome
#### Implement functions
  Erode
  Dilate
  Open, close, open/close, close/open
  Skeletonization
  Boundary extraction
